# TASK MANAGER WEB APPLICATION - 

•	This project is a web app where users can sign up, log in, and manage their Tasks efficiently. It's built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. MongoDB is used to store user data and task assigned by User. Users can securely register, log in, and perform actions like adding, editing, and deleting.

•	When a User opens the website it will be directed to " NEW REGISTRATION " or signup page where a User can create its account using username and password which will be integrated using Mongodb as a backened database.

•	If a User already have an account it will click on " Log in here " which will redirect the User to " LOGIN " page where a User can log in its account using already registered username and password.

•	Then the User will be directed to " TASK MANAGER WEB APPLICATION " page which is the main interface of the project where a User can create, update and delete their tasks according to its convenience. Users can also get the status of their tasks as the webpage shows both " pending " and " completed " tasks and all this task are stored on mongodb due to which whenever a User login again , His/Her data is never lost.
